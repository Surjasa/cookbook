       "The simple answer is **evolution**. Humans, along with other great apes (like chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans), evolved in a way that made tails unnecessary and even disadvantageous for our primary mode of locomotion and lifestyle.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a more detailed breakdown:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Our Ancestors Had Tails:** Our very distant primate ancestors *did* have tails. These were useful for balance when climbing through trees, for grasping branches (in some cases, like spider monkeys, who have prehensile tails), and for communication.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **The Shift to Apes:** The evolutionary lineage leading to humans diverged from monkeys millions of years ago. One of the key distinctions between Old World Monkeys (many of whom have tails) and Apes (none of whom have external tails) is this very feature.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Bipedalism and Upright Posture:** This is the most significant factor. As our ancestors began to spend more time on the ground and eventually evolved to walk upright on two legs (bipedalism):\n",
       "    *   **Balance:** A tail, which helps quadrupedal animals (four-legged) balance, became less useful for bipedal balance. Our upright posture and changes in our spine and pelvis allow us to balance differently.\n",
       "    *   **Energy Cost:** Building and maintaining a tail (with bones, muscles, nerves, and skin) requires energy and resources. If it's not providing a significant advantage, natural selection will favor individuals who don't expend those resources on a redundant structure.\n",
       "    *   **Hindrance:** A tail might even have become a hindrance, potentially getting in the way or becoming a liability when navigating varied terrain or escaping predators while walking upright.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Changes in Pelvis and Spine:** The evolution of bipedalism profoundly changed the structure of our pelvis and the curvature of our spine. These adaptations are crucial for supporting our body weight and maintaining balance while walking upright. A tail would require a different anatomical configuration that wouldn't fit well with our current structure.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **The Coccyx (Tailbone):** We still have a remnant of a tail! It's called the **coccyx**, or tailbone. This small, fused bone at the very bottom of our spine is the vestigial (non-functional remnant) of our ancestral tail. It serves a minor purpose today, providing an attachment point for some muscles and ligaments.\n",
       "\n",
       "6.  **Embryonic Development:** Interestingly, human embryos *do* have a tail-like structure (a \"caudal eminence\") during early development, around weeks 4-6. However, this structure normally recedes and is absorbed, fusing to form the coccyx. This fleeting embryonic tail is a powerful piece of evidence for our evolutionary history.\n",
       "\n",
       "In rare cases, babies are born with what is sometimes called a \"true human tail.\" This is a developmental anomaly (an atavism) where the embryonic tail structure doesn't fully regress. These are typically soft tissue growths and are usually removed surgically."

       "It's a fascinating question that delves deep into our evolutionary history! The short answer is that **humans, along with other great apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and bonobos), lost their tails over millions of years of evolution because it was no longer advantageous and eventually became a disadvantage for their changing lifestyles.**\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a breakdown of why:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Our Ancestors Had Tails:** Our very distant primate ancestors, like many monkeys today, definitely had tails. These tails were incredibly useful for:\n",
       "    *   **Balance:** Especially for arboreal (tree-dwelling) animals, a tail acts like a counterbalance, helping them navigate branches.\n",
       "    *   **Locomotion:** Some monkeys have prehensile tails, which can grip branches and act as a \"fifth limb.\"\n",
       "    *   **Communication:** Tails can be used to signal warnings, attract mates, or display dominance.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **The Evolutionary Split: Apes vs. Monkeys:**\n",
       "    *   Around 20-25 million years ago, the lineage that would lead to apes and humans diverged from the lineage of Old World monkeys. This was a critical point.\n",
       "    *   As our ape ancestors began to adopt different methods of moving through trees – like **brachiation** (swinging arm-over-arm) or spending more time upright – the tail became less essential for balance. In fact, a long, cumbersome tail could even become a hindrance.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Advantages of Losing the Tail:**\n",
       "    *   **Improved Upright Posture:** For ancestors who were starting to spend more time on the ground or adopting more upright postures in trees, a tail wasn't needed for balance. A streamlined torso became more efficient.\n",
       "    *   **Enhanced Stability for Sitting:** Losing the tail allowed for a more stable, broad base for sitting, which is important for a variety of activities, from eating to tool-making.\n",
       "    *   **Reduced Energy Expenditure:** Growing and maintaining a tail takes energy. If it's not useful, that energy is better spent elsewhere.\n",
       "    *   **Simplified Body Plan:** A tail is an appendage that can be injured or caught. Removing it simplified the body plan for a changing lifestyle.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **The Vestige: Our Coccyx (Tailbone):**\n",
       "    *   While we don't have an external tail, we do have a remnant: the **coccyx**, or tailbone. This small, triangular bone at the very end of our spine is made up of several fused vertebrae.\n",
       "    *   It's a **vestigial structure** – a clear anatomical \"fossil\" from our tailed ancestors. It still serves minor functions, like providing attachment points for some muscles and ligaments, and supporting the pelvic floor.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Embryonic Development:**\n",
       "    *   Interestingly, human embryos *do* develop a tail-like structure early in gestation (around 4-8 weeks). This is a fascinating glimpse into our evolutionary past, as it reflects the ancestral blueprint.\n",
       "    *   However, specific genes then trigger a process called **apoptosis** (programmed cell death), which causes these tail cells to be reabsorbed, and the structure regresses to form the coccyx. This genetic \"switch\" prevents the full development of an external tail.\n",
       "\n",
       "6.  **Rare Atavisms:**\n",
       "    *   Very rarely, due to a genetic mutation or developmental anomaly, a baby can be born with a small, fleshy \"vestigial tail.\" These are called **atavisms** – the reappearance of an ancestral trait that has been lost through evolution. They are usually benign and can be surgically removed.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the absence of a tail in humans is not an accident or a lack, but rather a profound evolutionary adaptation. It reflects a shift in locomotion and lifestyle that began millions of years ago, ultimately leading to the unique way humans and other apes navigate the world."

       "            text=\"\"\"The simple answer is **evolution**. Humans, along with other great apes (like chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans), evolved in a way that made tails unnecessary and even disadvantageous for our primary mode of locomotion and lifestyle.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a more detailed breakdown:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Our Ancestors Had Tails:** Our very distant primate ancestors *did* have tails. These were useful for balance when climbing through trees, for grasping branches (in some cases, like spider monkeys, who have prehensile tails), and for communication.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **The Shift to Apes:** The evolutionary lineage leading to humans diverged from monkeys millions of years ago. One of the key distinctions between Old World Monkeys (many of whom have tails) and Apes (none of whom have external tails) is this very feature.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Bipedalism and Upright Posture:** This is the most significant factor. As our ancestors began to spend more time on the ground and eventually evolved to walk upright on two legs (bipedalism):\n",
       "    *   **Balance:** A tail, which helps quadrupedal animals (four-legged) balance, became less useful for bipedal balance. Our upright posture and changes in our spine and pelvis allow us to balance differently.\n",
       "    *   **Energy Cost:** Building and maintaining a tail (with bones, muscles, nerves, and skin) requires energy and resources. If it's not providing a significant advantage, natural selection will favor individuals who don't expend those resources on a redundant structure.\n",
       "    *   **Hindrance:** A tail might even have become a hindrance, potentially getting in the way or becoming a liability when navigating varied terrain or escaping predators while walking upright.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Changes in Pelvis and Spine:** The evolution of bipedalism profoundly changed the structure of our pelvis and the curvature of our spine. These adaptations are crucial for supporting our body weight and maintaining balance while walking upright. A tail would require a different anatomical configuration that wouldn't fit well with our current structure.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **The Coccyx (Tailbone):** We still have a remnant of a tail! It's called the **coccyx**, or tailbone. This small, fused bone at the very bottom of our spine is the vestigial (non-functional remnant) of our ancestral tail. It serves a minor purpose today, providing an attachment point for some muscles and ligaments.\n",
       "\n",
       "6.  **Embryonic Development:** Interestingly, human embryos *do* have a tail-like structure (a \"caudal eminence\") during early development, around weeks 4-6. However, this structure normally recedes and is absorbed, fusing to form the coccyx. This fleeting embryonic tail is a powerful piece of evidence for our evolutionary history.\n",
       "\n",
       "In rare cases, babies are born with what is sometimes called a \"true human tail.\" This is a developmental anomaly (an atavism) where the embryonic tail structure doesn't fully regress. These are typically soft tissue growths and are usually removed surgically.\"\"\"\n",

       "            text=\"\"\"It's a fascinating question that delves deep into our evolutionary history! The short answer is that **humans, along with other great apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and bonobos), lost their tails over millions of years of evolution because it was no longer advantageous and eventually became a disadvantage for their changing lifestyles.**\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a breakdown of why:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Our Ancestors Had Tails:** Our very distant primate ancestors, like many monkeys today, definitely had tails. These tails were incredibly useful for:\n",
       "    *   **Balance:** Especially for arboreal (tree-dwelling) animals, a tail acts like a counterbalance, helping them navigate branches.\n",
       "    *   **Locomotion:** Some monkeys have prehensile tails, which can grip branches and act as a \"fifth limb.\"\n",
       "    *   **Communication:** Tails can be used to signal warnings, attract mates, or display dominance.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **The Evolutionary Split: Apes vs. Monkeys:**\n",
       "    *   Around 20-25 million years ago, the lineage that would lead to apes and humans diverged from the lineage of Old World monkeys. This was a critical point.\n",
       "    *   As our ape ancestors began to adopt different methods of moving through trees – like **brachiation** (swinging arm-over-arm) or spending more time upright – the tail became less essential for balance. In fact, a long, cumbersome tail could even become a hindrance.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Advantages of Losing the Tail:**\n",
       "    *   **Improved Upright Posture:** For ancestors who were starting to spend more time on the ground or adopting more upright postures in trees, a tail wasn't needed for balance. A streamlined torso became more efficient.\n",
       "    *   **Enhanced Stability for Sitting:** Losing the tail allowed for a more stable, broad base for sitting, which is important for a variety of activities, from eating to tool-making.\n",
       "    *   **Reduced Energy Expenditure:** Growing and maintaining a tail takes energy. If it's not useful, that energy is better spent elsewhere.\n",
       "    *   **Simplified Body Plan:** A tail is an appendage that can be injured or caught. Removing it simplified the body plan for a changing lifestyle.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **The Vestige: Our Coccyx (Tailbone):**\n",
       "    *   While we don't have an external tail, we do have a remnant: the **coccyx**, or tailbone. This small, triangular bone at the very end of our spine is made up of several fused vertebrae.\n",
       "    *   It's a **vestigial structure** – a clear anatomical \"fossil\" from our tailed ancestors. It still serves minor functions, like providing attachment points for some muscles and ligaments, and supporting the pelvic floor.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Embryonic Development:**\n",
       "    *   Interestingly, human embryos *do* develop a tail-like structure early in gestation (around 4-8 weeks). This is a fascinating glimpse into our evolutionary past, as it reflects the ancestral blueprint.\n",
       "    *   However, specific genes then trigger a process called **apoptosis** (programmed cell death), which causes these tail cells to be reabsorbed, and the structure regresses to form the coccyx. This genetic \"switch\" prevents the full development of an external tail.\n",
       "\n",
       "6.  **Rare Atavisms:**\n",
       "    *   Very rarely, due to a genetic mutation or developmental anomaly, a baby can be born with a small, fleshy \"vestigial tail.\" These are called **atavisms** – the reappearance of an ancestral trait that has been lost through evolution. They are usually benign and can be surgically removed.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the absence of a tail in humans is not an accident or a lack, but rather a profound evolutionary adaptation. It reflects a shift in locomotion and lifestyle that began millions of years ago, ultimately leading to the unique way humans and other apes navigate the world.\"\"\"\n",

    "Additionally, the `frequency_penalty` parameter, which was available in older models, is not supported in Gemini 2.5. The new model architecture inherently handles repetition issues, but this can lead to scenarios where token allocation is dominated by internal reasoning rather than output generation.\n",
